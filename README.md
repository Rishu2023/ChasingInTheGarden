# ChasingInTheGarden
This was a Genius Hour Project I made when I was in 8th grade which was based on Snake Game except the Snake is now the worm and the leaves were the target. In this project, I named it "Chasing In The Garden". In this project, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and p5.js. I used a few tips from Khan Academy which really helped me. I hope you enjoy.
